psychtypes
==========

Some simple Java code to deal with messing around with Jungian psychological
typing, a la Myers-Briggs testing and the like. See

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type

This code doesn't contain any actual content but rather the data types and
classes used to setup a test and do type transforms etc.
